But \"Sharing is Caring\", so I made it public anyway.\r\n\r\nIf you are an experienced Network/Systems Engineer, these posts might be perfectly short, sweet and helpful.\r\nIf you are not experienced you will probably find most notes do not have enough detail to explain things, as they are about the how, rather than the why.\r\nIf you want the how, their is plenty of material and other blogs for that, which I wont duplicate.\r\n\r\n### Code Repos\r\nhttp://code.lemin.io\r\nI am not a developer, repeat, I am not a devloper ;) - So pls dont chastise for code quality.\r\nWhilst I used to develop a lot using Java, J2EE, MFC (showing my age) JavaScript, PHP etc, I do not dev anymore.\r\n\r\nBut as a Network Engineer with a passion for OpenSource, Automation, and DevOps, and a keen focus in Programable Networks, Overlays, WANs, Private Clouds (OpenStack), and Kubernetees/Mesos stacks etc. I do as a result still write lots of scripts including Bash, Python, Ruby (Puppet), Perl and Ansible (not technically a language).\r\n\r\nOther lesser known favourite languages include LaTeX, MatLab, Spice (Electronics days) and a little bit of C/C++.\r\nMy repos are just a collection of scripts and settings I have written and found useful over the years.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHere: andy.lemin.io\r\nTwitter: @andylemin\r\nFaceBook: face.lemin.io",
